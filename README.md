# Flutter Clean Architecture & TDD Practice

This Flutter project is a work-in-progress based on the YouTube playlist: [Clean Architecture & TDD - Reso Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjE2IDphA_U&list=PLB6lc7nQ1n4iYGE_khpXRdJkJEp9WOech). The goal of this project is to learn and apply Clean Architecture principles, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and best practices for scalable Flutter applications.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

* Understand the structure of Clean Architecture in a Flutter context
* Practice writing unit, widget, and integration tests
* Learn to separate concerns via layers: `Presentation`, `Domain`, and `Data`
* Implement Dependency Injection and SOLID principles


## ðŸ”— Architecture Overview

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/              # Shared code like error handling and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ features/          # Feature-specific folders
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ number_trivia/ # Example feature from the tutorial
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ domain/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ presentation/
â””â”€â”€ main.dart
```
